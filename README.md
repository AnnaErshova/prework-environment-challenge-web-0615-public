# Prework Environment Checker

Now that you've completed your [First Lab](http://learn.flatironschool.com/lessons/1013), we're going to make sure that you've installed everything okay when you configured your environment back in [Environment Setup](http://learn.flatironschool.com/lessons/1171).

All you need to do is run `ironboard`, which will run the tests in the `spec/` directory. Don't worry if running the tests takes a few seconds to finish. If everything's all green, you're good to go! If you need help, click the "Need Help" button.

Next:

* Stage the changes you made: `git add .`
* Commit those changes with a message: `git commit -m "all done"`
* Push those changed up to your fork: `git push origin master`
* Then open up a pull request on the original repository (that you cloned from).
